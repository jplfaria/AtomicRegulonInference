module-name:
    AtomicRegulonInference

module-description:
    Here we propose a new algorithm for computing Atomic Regulons (ARs), which combines many of the advantages of the existing data-driven approaches, but integrates new evidence types including gene context and functional relationships to more quickly converge on a complete set of biologically meaningful ARs. Our algorithm is unique from other approaches in that it begins by constructing draft ARs using a combination of operon predictions and SEED subsystem technology.
